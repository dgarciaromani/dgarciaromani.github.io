        "Social Determinants of Health encompass the conditions under which individuals are born, grow, live, work, and age, and the impact of these conditions on their overall health and well-being. These determinants include various factors such as income, education, employment, housing, and social support. Extensive research has consistently shown that social determinants of health significantly influence individuals' health outcomes, with those experiencing disadvantage in these areas being at a higher risk of poor health and chronic diseases. Understanding and addressing social determinants of health is crucial for improving population health overall and achieving health equity.",
        "This project was collaboratively developed with colleagues from my master's degree program, aiming to synthesize this data into an easily accessible website. Our objective was to demonstrate the disparities in opportunities across different areas of the United States.",
        "For this project, we selected two primary datasets: one focusing on Social Determinants of Health and the other on health outcomes. Both datasets contain more than 70,000 rows each and were collected at the census tract level. Census tracts are statistical subdivisions of a county that can be updated by local participants before each decennial census. Census tracts offer a smaller level of granularity compared to zip codes, enabling us to highlight significant differences even within relatively close geographical areas. We joined the data based on the census tract to establish correlations between Social Determinants of Health and health outcomes.",
        "To build the project, we utilized MySQL as our SQL database. Originally, the database was hosted on AWS RDS, but I changed the code so it would work on a local instance of MySQL 8. The front end was developed using React, while the back end was constructed with Nodejs. We incorporated the MUI JavaScript library, as well as Leaflet and Leaflet-react, which allowed us to visualize GeoJSON data on a map. These tools and technologies formed the foundation of our project, enabling us to present the information effectively and create meaningful visualizations.",

The data set we worked with covered different topics, such as COVID data (~25,000 rows), property data (~580,000 rows), and the 2020 populations of Philadelphia ZIP Codes.",
        "The objective was to create a Java program capable of reading and parsing CSV and JSON files, extracting relevant information, and performing calculations and analysis based on user input. After loading all the input data, the program displays a menu of possible actions and prompts the user to specify the action to be performed, such as showing the total population for all ZIP Codes, the total vaccinations per capita for each ZIP Code on the specified date, the average market value for properties in a specified ZIP Code, the average total livable area for properties in a specified ZIP Code, and the total market value of properties per capita for a specified ZIP Code, among others.",
        "The program takes four optional runtime arguments as input: the name of the COVID data file, the name of the property values file, the name of the population data file, and the name of the log file. When the program finishes reading and parsing the files and extracting relevant information, it prints the menu to the console so the user can select the action. With this input, the program then executes the action given by the user, prints the results, and displays the main menu again, awaiting the next input.",
        "We designed a modular program using a 3-tier architecture, splitting the program into three subsystems: the data tier, which handles functionality related to storing and retrieving data; the logic tier, where the necessary calculations are performed; and the user interface tier, which interacts with the user. Additionally, we created different utility classes to bundle information to be passed between different tiers, a main class to create objects in the other tiers and establish their relationships (such as passing one object to the constructor of another and initializing the application through the user interface), and a logger class to record all user inputs and actions performed.",
        "My teammate and I worked together on the overall design, but we divided our responsibilities. My teammate focused on the logic tier, where she handled the necessary calculations and data processing. On the other hand, I took charge of the data and user interface tier, managing tasks related to storing and retrieving data, as well as interacting with the user. This division of work allowed us to effectively utilize our strengths and skills while maintaining a cohesive approach to the project's development. Through close collaboration and mutual understanding, we successfully created a well-structured application.",

        "As part of my Introduction to Software Development course, I implemented a Python version of the game Tower Blaster using PyCharm. Tower Blaster is a game where the player rearranges a group of bricks to create an increasing sequence. In this project, my task was to develop the game for a user versus computer scenario.",
        "The game starts with a main pile of 60 bricks, numbered from 1 to 60, represented as a list. The objective is to arrange 10 bricks in ascending order in your own tower. At the beginning of the game, both the user and the computer are dealt 10 bricks from the main pile, following the convention of placing the bricks on top of each other. During the game, players take turns choosing a brick either from the discard pile (which is face up) or from the main pile (which is face down). The chosen brick is then placed in the player's tower, replacing an existing brick. If a brick is taken from the main pile and rejected, it is placed in the discard pile without affecting the player's tower. The program utilizes the console to display the instructions, the different piles, and prompts the user for input.",
        "Another part of the project was to design the computer's strategy. In my case, I programmed the computer to take the top brick from the discard pile and place it in a specific section of the tower. The goal was to develop a strategy that ensures the computer doesn't always lose to a human player.",
        "To implement this project, I utilized different functions to create the main and discard piles, shuffle the bricks at the beginning of the game, check the availability of bricks in the main pile, and handle shuffling if necessary. I also implemented functions to determine if stability has been achieved in a tower, remove and return the top brick from a given pile, deal initial bricks to the user and the computer, add a brick to the discard pile, find and replace a brick in a tower, and implement the computer's decision-making process.",
        "Completing this project provided me with a deeper understanding of working with lists and tuples in Python, as well as enhanced my problem-solving skills and logical thinking in game development scenarios.",
        "Please note that the code for this project is unavailable for sharing, as per course requirements.",

      preview: "This project showcases my UX/UI skills applied to a tangible problem space. The app I designed is specifically tailored to address the everyday questions and concerns of university students by providing them with comprehensive information. Completing this project offered me hands-on experience in applying the different phases of the UX design process.",

        "As a student who personally experienced the challenges of finding information quickly and effectively at my university, I felt compelled to address these issues for future students. It was clear that many of us struggled to navigate through various webpages, social networks, and other resources just to access the information we needed. The lack of a centralized platform that could accommodate our mobile needs was a major pain point. That's why I embarked on the development of the 'My UC' app.",
        "This app aims to provide a solution by offering a user-friendly interface where students can easily access their class schedules, obtain information about their classes and fellow students, navigate campus using maps and directions, utilize library services, stay informed about events and news, and find information about safety and emergencies. Through extensive research, including user interviews and surveys, I gained valuable insights into the needs and preferences of university students. I used this information to create user personas, design the app's information architecture, and develop user flows and sketches. Rigorous testing and feedback allowed me to refine the wireframes and design a polished user interface using Figma.",
